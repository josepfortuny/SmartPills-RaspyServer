# SmartPills-RaspyServer

## Use Case

This is the second part of the hardware where the user take's one of the two pills, and a camera recognizes which pill was taken using machine learning.
It also sends the information to the firebase backend which shows the app where and when the pill was taken.
For last there is a little menu where the user can visualize the pills that needs to be taken or the pills taked during the week.
